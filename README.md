# Deployit Community Plugins #

Welcome to the Deployit community plugin repository on github!

Here you will find plugins that can be used to add capabilities to your existing Deployit installation. The source code
for the plugins is also provided if you are curious to see how a plugin works or want to improve it.

_Note: the plugins here are provided as-is as a service to Deployit users. Support for these plugins is provided through
XebiaLabs' professional services department._

# Finding a plugin

All plugins are located in directories inside the main community-plugins repository. Browse the main directory to find
the list of plugins and navigate into a plugin directory to find the plugin's documentation and source code.

# Downloading a plugin

You can find compiled, ready-to-install binaries in the _Downloads_ section of the repository. If you want, you can clone
or fork the repository and compile the plugin from the source code.

# Installing a plugin

Installing a plugin is as simple as copying the plugin jar file into the _plugins_ directory in your Deployit server
installation directory. See Deployit's *System Administration Manual* for more information.

# Contributing to a plugin

If you want to add features to a plugin, fix a bug or otherwise contribute, great! Fork the community-plugins repository,
make your changes, test them and submit a pull request to us so we can incorporate your changes and make them available
to other Deployit users.

# Enjoy!

We hope the plugins provided here will help you make the most of Deployit. Please let us know what you think by posting a 
message on our support site at http://support.xebialabs.com.

Sincerely,

[XebiaLabs](http://www.xebialabs.com/sites/all/themes/xebialabs/logo.png)
