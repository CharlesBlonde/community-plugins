# Deployit Community Plugins #

Welcome to the Deployit community plugin repository on github!

Here you will find plugins that can be used to add capabilities to your existing [Deployit](http://www.xebialabs.com/tour) installation. The source code
for the plugins is also provided if you are curious to see how a plugin works or want to improve it.

_Note: the plugins here are provided on an as-is basis as a service to Deployit users. Support for these plugins is provided through
XebiaLabs' professional services department._

# Finding a plugin

All plugins are located in directories inside the main community-plugins repository. Browse the main directory to find
the list of plugins and navigate into a plugin directory to find the plugin's documentation and source code.

## deployit-udm-plugins

This directory contains Deployit plugins that are based on the Unified Deployment Model.

## deployit-server-plugins

This directory contains Deployit server plugins that influence server behavior.

## deployit-cli-plugins

This directory contains Deployit CLI plugins that influence CLI behavior.

## tool-deployit-plugins

This directory contains plugins for external tools that interact with Deployit.

# Downloading a plugin

You can find compiled, ready-to-install binaries in the [_Downloads_](https://github.com/xebialabs/community-plugins/downloads) section of the repository. If you want, you can clone
or fork the repository and compile the plugin from the source code.

# Installing a plugin

Installing a plugin is as simple as copying the plugin jar file into the _plugins_ directory in your Deployit server
installation directory. See Deployit's *System Administration Manual* for more information.

# Contributing to a plugin

If you want to add features to a plugin, fix a bug or otherwise contribute, great! Fork the community-plugins repository,
make your changes, test them and submit a pull request to us so we can incorporate your changes and make them available
to other Deployit users.

# Discussing plugins

The [Deployit user forum](http://support.xebialabs.com/forums/20273366-deployit-users) is a place where you can discuss these community plugins (or other Deployit installation and configuration topics) with fellow Deployit users.

# Enjoy!

We hope the plugins provided here will help you make the most of Deployit. Please let us know what you think by posting a
